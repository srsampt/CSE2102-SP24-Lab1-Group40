# CSE2102-SP24-Lab1-Group40

My main class diagram is Lab1-Class-Diagram.pdf/

There are also 2 additional class diagram PDFs (in the "Class Diagrams with Notes" folder) where I've provided notes on my thought process / the steps I took.
- Notes_On_Classes: This file includes notes on the structure and functionality of each of the classes.
- Notes_On_Relationships: This file includes notes on the relationships between the classes.
