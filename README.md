## LAB 1

My main class diagram is Lab1-Class-Diagram.pdf.

There are also 2 additional class diagram PDFs (in the "Class Diagrams with Notes" folder) where I've provided notes on my thought process / the steps I took.
- Notes_On_Classes: This file includes notes on the structure and functionality of each of the 3 classes I crated.
- Notes_On_Relationships: This file includes notes on the relationships between the classes (e.g. aggregation, composition).

I worked alone on this lab, so you will find that Lab1-SubmissionFile.pdf contains only a self-evaluation.

## BONUS POINTS
See lab1_oop.py for my converted OOP code.

## LAB 2

I created a few variations of my sequence diagram (sequence-diagram-1, sequence-diagram-2, sd-draft). I also included supplementary PDFs with annotations (sequence-diagram-1-with-notes, sequence-diagram-2-with-notes).
