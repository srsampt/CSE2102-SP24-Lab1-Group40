# CSE2102-SP24-Lab1-Group40

My main class diagram is Lab1-Class-Diagram.pdf.

There are also 2 additional class diagram PDFs (in the "Class Diagrams with Notes" folder) where I've provided notes on my thought process / the steps I took.
- Notes_On_Classes: This file includes notes on the structure and functionality of each of the 3 classes I crated.
- Notes_On_Relationships: This file includes notes on the relationships between the classes (e.g. aggregation, composition).

I worked alone on this lab, so you will find that Lab1-SubmissionFile.pdf contains only a self-evaluation.
